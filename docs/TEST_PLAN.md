### E. Test Plan for Validation

**Objective:** Confirm the Python translation matches the behavior of the original Fortran version.

**Tests performed:**
1. **Unit tests** for each method in `WeatherModel` (average_temp, max_wind, classify_day).  
2. **Integration test** using `pytest` to confirm end-to-end results.  
3. **Manual verification** of sample dataset outputs.  

**Data used:** `data/weather_sample.csv`

**Pass criteria:**  
All tests in `tests/test_weather.py` must pass, and results must be within Â±1e-9 tolerance compared to the Fortran reference.
