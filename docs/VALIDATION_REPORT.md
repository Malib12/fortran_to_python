### F. Testing and Validation Discussion

**Method chosen:**  
I used automated testing with `pytest` because it provides fast, repeatable validation.  
Each time I pushed changes to GitHub, I reran all tests to ensure nothing is broken.

**Why this method:**  
- Simple to set up and integrates well with Python, gives clear pass/fail results for every function, and ensures long-term reliability if more features are added.

**Results:**  
All tests passed successfully. The Python translation produced the same outputs as the Fortran version within floating-point tolerance.
